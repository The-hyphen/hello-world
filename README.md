# hello-world
My first git hub repository! Just testing the waters :)
I'm a high school teacher with a background in science communication and environmental education, who is making the transition into programming (with the goal of becoming a full stack developer).
I live in Brisbane, Australia and have an unhealthy obsession with nachos and pad thai.
